# NHS App prototype

## About the NHS App prototype

The NHS App prototype enables you to make interactive prototypes that will look like pages on the NHS App. The prototypes you make are a great way to show ideas to others and for conducting user research.

Built using the [NHS prototype kit](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/) with added code from the [NHS App frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend) for [NHS App specific components](https://design-system.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/components/).

### Running the kit

Start the kit with `npm run watch`.
