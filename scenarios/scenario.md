## Scenario Overview

The "Deterioration Radar" is a lightweight web application designed to support acute and frontline NHS staff in environments where patients are dispersed across corridors, waiting areas, temporary wards, or overflow spaces. These non-standard care settings often lack the structure and consistency of traditional wards, leading to fragmented observations, delayed vital sign entries, and unclear lines of responsibility. The system aims to provide a unified, real-time view of patient status, helping staff quickly identify and escalate cases of clinical deterioration.

The primary users include healthcare assistants (HCAs) who capture patient observations, triage and ward nurses who review risk, nurse-in-charge or site teams who coordinate escalation, and on-call doctors or rapid response teams who respond to deteriorating patients. The app streamlines the workflow by enabling rapid manual entry of vital signs (or simulated device feeds), automatically calculating risk scores, and flagging missing or outdated observations. A "priority board" ranks patients by risk and time since last observation, providing clear prompts for next actions and suggesting escalation templates (such as SBAR) for concise handover. Escalations are logged, creating a minimal audit trail and supporting rapid-response summaries, with optional features like nudges for missing data, trend charts, alert stubs, and PDF summaries.

## Problem Statement

In dispersed and non-standard care environments, patient deterioration is frequently missed due to inconsistent or delayed vital sign entries, fragmented notes, and distributed responsibility among busy teams. This can lead to delayed interventions, increased risk of harm, and poor outcomes for patients. Staff struggle to maintain situational awareness, prioritise care, and coordinate effective escalation, especially when information is incomplete or scattered.

The "Deterioration Radar" addresses this by providing a single, prioritised view of all at-risk patients, highlighting missing or stale data, and standardising escalation processes. Success will be measured by improved detection and escalation of deteriorating patients, reduced delays in intervention, and enhanced confidence among staff in managing patients across challenging environments. The system aims to support safer, more responsive care and a clear audit trail for rapid response teams.
