### Objective
Research and create detailed user personas for every role involved in the described system, using real-world UK NHS job titles and organizational context. Include both NHS staff roles and non-NHS roles (such as patients, carers, family members, external partners, and other stakeholders).

**Important**: Each persona should be written as if describing a specific individual person, not a generalized role. Use concrete details, specific behaviors, and personal context to make each persona feel real and relatable.

### Persona Requirements

For each identified role, create a comprehensive persona using the following template:

**Persona Template Structure:**
1. **Persona Name &amp; Role**
   - Fictional first name (representative names)
   - Official UK NHS job title (for NHS staff) OR role description (for patients, carers, family members, etc.)
   - Position level and department/specialty (if applicable)
   - Reporting structure context (for NHS staff) OR relationship to care/system (for non-NHS roles)
   - Brief personal background (e.g., years in role, previous experience, personal situation)

2. **Goals &amp; Outcomes**
   - Primary objectives in their role (specific to this individual)
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs) they personally track
   - Success metrics that matter to them
   - Desired outcomes from using the system (in their own words/perspective)

3. **Wants, Needs &amp; Expectations**
   - Their specific daily workflow requirements
   - Information and resources they rely on
   - Their technology expectations and preferences
   - Support and training needs based on their experience level
   - How they prefer to communicate

4. **Biggest Pain Points &amp; Unmet Needs**
   - Their current frustrations and challenges (be specific)
   - Workflow bottlenecks they experience
   - System limitations that affect them personally
   - Time-consuming tasks they wish were automated
   - Specific gaps in current solutions that impact their work

5. **Additional Context**
   - A typical day-in-the-life for this specific person
   - Their technical proficiency level (with examples)
   - Their key stakeholder relationships
   - Their decision-making authority (if applicable)
   - Regulatory/compliance considerations they deal with (for staff roles)
   - Personal circumstances and accessibility needs (for patients/carers)
   - Their specific workload and time constraints
   - Cultural, linguistic, or socioeconomic factors relevant to them

### Coverage Requirements

1. **Framework Levels**: Ensure personas cover all three framework levels:
   - Strategic/Leadership level
   - Tactical/Management level
   - Operational/Front-line level

2. **Workflow Stages**: Identify and group personas by their primary involvement in workflow stages (e.g., planning, execution, monitoring, reporting, governance)

3. **Complete Ecosystem**: Include all roles that:
   - Directly interact with the system
   - Provide input or dependencies
   - Consume outputs or reports
   - Approve or govern processes
   - Support or maintain the system
   - Are impacted by system outcomes
   - **Non-NHS roles such as:**
     - Patients (various demographics, conditions, and accessibility needs)
     - Family members and carers
     - Informal carers
     - Community support workers
     - Social care providers
     - Third-sector organizations
     - External partners and suppliers
     - Volunteers
     - Patient advocacy groups

### Output Format

- **One persona per slide/section**
- **Each persona has a fictional first name** to humanize them (use diverse, representative UK names)
- **Write each persona as if describing a specific individual person**, not a generalized role type
- Use concrete, specific details and examples throughout
- **Group personas by workflow stage** (clearly labeled)
- Use consistent formatting across all personas
- Include realistic UK NHS context, terminology, and constraints
- Base findings on actual NHS organizational structures and real job roles
- **Provide citations** wherever possible to support claims about:
  - Job roles and responsibilities (link to NHS job frameworks, e.g., Agenda for Change)
  - Typical challenges and pain points (link to reports, surveys, studies)
  - NHS organizational structures and hierarchies
  - Patient experiences and statistics
  - Regulatory requirements and standards

### Research Approach

- Reference current NHS job frameworks and role definitions for staff roles
- Consider NHS organizational hierarchies and typical team structures
- Include NHS-specific challenges (e.g., resource constraints, patient safety priorities, regulatory requirements)
- Reflect realistic workloads and operational pressures in NHS settings
- **Provide citations and sources** for all factual claims, including:
  - NHS job frameworks (e.g., NHS Agenda for Change, Medical and Dental pay scales)
  - NHS policies and guidance documents
  - Research studies on NHS workforce or patient experiences
  - Official NHS statistics and reports
  - Regulatory frameworks (CQC, ICO, MHRA, etc.)
  - Industry reports and surveys
- **For patient and carer personas:**
  - Consider diverse demographics (age, disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic background)
  - Include varying levels of health literacy and digital literacy
  - Reflect real patient/carer experiences and challenges in navigating NHS services
  - Consider accessibility requirements and barriers to access
  - Include mental capacity and cognitive considerations where relevant
  - Cite patient experience data and research where available
