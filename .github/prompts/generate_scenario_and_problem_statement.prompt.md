Take the scenario description I provide and formalize it into a clear, structured format. Ask clarifying questions to ensure the scenario is well-defined and focused on a specific scenario rather than a broad topic.

Create:

## Scenario Overview
Write 2-3 paragraphs describing:
- What the system/initiative is
- Who it serves (NHS staff, patients, carers, etc.)
- Current state and what's being changed
- Key workflow stages involved

## Problem Statement
Write 1-2 paragraphs describing:
- The core problem being solved
- Why it matters (impact on patients, staff, organization)
- What success looks like

Use proper NHS terminology and context. Fill in reasonable assumptions where details are missing.
